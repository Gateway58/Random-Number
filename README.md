You need somthing to run this when you came from my presentation. 
Bad Operating systems: 
VScode (Text Editor): https://code.visualstudio.com/
To run stuff: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/ 
Be careful with downloads! 
Linux (with apt manager): 
sudo apt-get install gcc 
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install snap 
search vscode in snap store, gnome store or online.Im sure you'll will find somthing :)
